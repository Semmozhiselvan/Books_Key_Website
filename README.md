This is a simple and intuitive book management app that lets users keep track of their personal library. It allows users to add, view, and delete book entries dynamically on the homepage. Data is stored using a key-based storage method, such as local storage, so the information persists across sessions.

âœ¨ Features
- Add a Book: Users can enter the book title, author, and a brief description, then click the Add button. The book is instantly displayed on the home page.
- Book Display: Added books are shown in a clean, readable format, helping users visualize their collection.
- Delete Option: Each book entry includes a delete button, allowing users to remove a book from the list as needed.
- Local Storage: The app utilizes localStorage (or a similar key-based storage technique), so all the data stays available even after a page reload.
